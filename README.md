# Air-Quality-Index-Prediction
In this project we are predicting the air quality index for the city and till now we have trained our model on the past years dataset of New Delhi.
We applied different ML models like Linear regression, Random forest and Deep Learning model like Forward-feeding ANN(Artificial Neural Network) which 
turned out to be the best model in terms of predicting our output values and integrated it with the web application where in the backend part we are paasing
the dataset of a location through the api like google api,weather api and the output of aqi is being predicted there in the backend with DL model deployed.
